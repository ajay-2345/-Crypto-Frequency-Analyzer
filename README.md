# Crypto Frequency Analyzer

# The Crypto Frequency Analyzer is a comprehensive tool specifically designed for the analysis and decryption of mono-character encoded ciphers. The name speaks to its primary function of analyzing the frequency of characters within an encrypted message, a common technique used in cryptanalysis to break codes and ciphers.
 
# The interface of the Crypto Frequency Analyzer is highly interactive and user-friendly. It features multiple display boxes to streamline the decryption process. The first box is designed for input, allowing users to enter the encrypted text they wish to decode. This can include messages that have been encoded using a variety of mono-character encryption methods.
 
# The second display box is used to monitor the modifications applied to the cipher text. It allows users to see the changes made to the text in real-time, as they adjust different parameters and apply various decryption strategies. This feature supports the iterative process of decoding, enabling users to experiment with different approaches and immediately see the effects of their alterations.
 
# The third display box is used to track the changes made throughout the decryption process. This not only ensures full transparency of the changes applied but also helps users follow their steps backwards if needed. It's especially useful for complex ciphers and lengthy decryption processes where users might need to backtrack or revisit earlier steps.
 
# One of the standout features of the Crypto Frequency Analyzer is its ability to swap characters. This is a critical tool in mono-character decryption, allowing users to replace a particular character in the cipher text with another one. To make it easier for users to distinguish between the original and swapped characters, the swapped letters are automatically changed to lower case. This visual distinction aids in identifying the changes more easily and enhances the overall decryption process.
 
# In conclusion, the Crypto Frequency Analyzer is a powerful tool for cryptanalysis, offering a blend of interactive features and user-centric design that makes decoding mono-character ciphers an intuitive and engaging process.
